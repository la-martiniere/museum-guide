The portrait, in profile, is one of fifty-three drawings by Johan Zoffany, executed during the 1790's for his friend in India. Trois crayons is a drawing technique using three colours of chalk: red, black, and white,

In Wolff's Album we find two portraits of Claude Martin - the portrait in profile bearing Zoffany's comment "This Find Of Wery Leick". These may have been executed during his stay with Martin in Lucknow or more likely in England and after studies from India.
