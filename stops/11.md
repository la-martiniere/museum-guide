Local Artist, Ajay Tulsi presents an artistic impression of Claude Martin and the College endowed by him, to commemorate the 125 anniversary of the establishment of the College, in 1995. The image of the Founder is surrounded by the chief features of La Martiniere Lucknow. Constantia, a view from the East fills the upper part of the painting.

The Lord Cornwallis cannon, built by Claude Martin in the Lucknow arsenal, faces the Lat or memorial column to the Founder. The West view of the College, seen from the rear of the bust of the Founder in the West garden, balances the picture on the right.
