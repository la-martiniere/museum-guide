The portrait is attributed to the Scottish Painter, Charles Smith. In 1783 Smith travelled to India. He was introduced to the Nawab of Oudh by the Governor General, John Macpherson. Lucknow, in particular, was at that time a hub of artistic activity. He is most likely to have painted this portrait of Claude Martin.
