The painting depicts Colonel Antoine Polier, Claude Martin, John Wombwell and the painter, amidst Polier's collection of paintings. They are waited on by Indian servants. Zoffany is at his easel in the centre. Polier is seen selecting fruit and vegetables. An attendant feeds a banana to a monkey. 

Claude Martin is showing an oil painting on a roll of canvas of Farhat Baksh to Wombwell, who has a bulging accounting book near him. On the walls of the room are other Indian scenes.
