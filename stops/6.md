## Version 6 - (Colonel Mordaunt, Company School Patna)
<div style="text-align: justify">
The painting is by an artist of the Patna School based upon a mezzotint done by Richard Earlom Col. Mordaunt's Cockfight. There are some modifications. The artist has replaced Zoffany's original outdoor scene of an awning and trees with the fa√ßade of a colonial-style building. He has reversed and focused the scene of the cockfight, centring on the confrontation between Colonel John Mordaunt and Nawab Asaf al-Daula.
